# Thursday 2/6 — 15th day after

**Highlight:** Major release in left hip.

* Woke on right side with left side flared up (jaw/neck/shoulder/upper arm).
* After I got up, I felt an ache deep in left hip/glutes, and a pulling from my left waist down. It’s achy all over.
* While standing with heel on counter (applying lotion to legs), left hip felt slightly less constricted and the positions are slightly more symmetrical.
* When I shift weight to just the left leg, it feels connected and stable from heel to top of leg/pelvis, and the muscles that are always tensed up there like a single block now feel like they are letting go to some degree.
    * Even seated in an armchair, I can feel the ache and pull.
    * Did a deep squat stretch and can feel the left hip/glutes/lower back/waist relax and stretch. 
    * When seated and leaning forward to tie shoes, the left side/waist/glutes are letting go and relaxing instead of tightening up like they usually do. 
* On the walk to the bus after work I realized I hadn’t felt any further pain or tightness anywhere and the back of my left hip felt open and less rotated. Walking upright with easy extended neck.
* On the bus ride home I felt like I was siting evenly and that my left hip was relaxed instead of the usual constant bracing.
* Yoga:
    * Felt more symmetrical than ever. Back of left hip (gluteus medius? minimus?) was open and everything felt open and like it had dropped and unrotated.
    * Got deeper stretches through my left side/waist.
    * Low lunge: As on Monday, I grabbed back foot when in low lunge, and got very deep hip stretches, more significantly on the right side. It felt profoundly relaxing to stretch that deeply, and I had crazy sighs of relief.
    * Arms and shoulders already feel way stronger and more stable. Hopefully that strength and coordination takes pressure off the neck and helps avoid compensatory patterns.
    * Afterward, walking around my apartment, I feel crunching sensations in the back of my left hip. Seated, it feels kind of warm and very mildly achy. My waist on left side occasionally twinges very slightly.
    * Left shoulder/neck /jaw are flared up slightly. Pushed up on roof of mouth from the floor of mouth, and that helped relieve tension and I feel an itch in the middle of my left ear. It was like what I did on the right side yesterday that gave me that “clunk” and alignment feeling.
* I continue to not be particularly hungry. When I am, it’s pretty mild and I feel full fast.
*  Walking and standing around my apartment, I feel the left hip has opened up and unrotated significantly. I cannot believe this feeling.
* Noticed I no longer feel a pull/tension in the back of my neck when I swallow. There’a mild twinge, but no tension like before.
* I still can’t clench my jaw like before. I can make myself squeeze my teeth together, but the jaw clenching action is impossible.
* Ever since the “clunk” thing last night, tongue had been against alveolear ridge, and further back in mouth, the continue has full contact from side to side. It feels relaxed and comfortable and natural.
   * Like yesterday, it feels like previously I jutted my jaw forward slightly, and now it’s back and up. I now notice when it feels wrong and can relax it and let my tongue manage the position and tension, rather than the muscles around the jaw joint.
* Neck and shoulders feel very open and not at all constricted. The back of my neck has zero knots.
   * **I used to think I had major anxiety that manifested as severe physical tension. Speech therapy helped with some of it, but the significant muscle release / tension relied I’ve had since the frenectomy has me concluding that I never had anxiety. I just had a constant state of tension and attributed it to a mental/emotional reason.**
      * I feel calm and relaxed in general now, where before I felt permanently tense and rotated. I could just not relax. I couldn’t do it. Now a relaxed state is my baseline.
* Like yesterday, feels like previously I jutted my jaw forward slightly, and now it’s back and up.
* I no longer feel severe tightness when pulling tongue up to the roof of my mouth and stretching. (From the former tie which is of course gone, or the wound.) It is starting to feel just like a regular muscle stretch. There’s a tiny bit of white at the wound, but it’s almost healed up.
* Lip, mouth, facial tension are practically gone.
* Yawning is very comfortable for jaw and tongue now. Before, it would get sore at the tie, and the stretch was not as satisfying as it is now through throat and neck and jaw.

# Friday 2/7 — 16th day after

* Not a lot to report so far (2 p.m.). Went for a mile+ walk at lunch.
   * Felt quite symmetrical and like my legs were tracking straight ahead, able to engage glute medius like I haven’t before. 
   * Hips are still rotated and tilted but less so. 
   * Much more freedom of movement in back left hip. 
* Very mild strain in back right neck and shoulder but not bothering me.

# Saturday 2/8 — 17th day after

* Getting out of bed, I’m amazed and delighted by how level, stable, and light I feel. 
* Jeans are fitting differently, not being pulled because of the rotation. 
* Going up stairs, the back of my left hip (from top of pelvis down) feels open and unstrained, maybe just a slight twinge. Previously it felt like the whole hip moved as one block and it strained.
* No neck/jaw/shoulder strain so far (4:30 p.m.).
* Yoga:
    * Generally, my neck is almost always relaxed and open, not compensating and “helping” in poses.
    * Low lunge with back foot hold: Deeper and deeper stretch.
    * 3-legged dog: Stronger shoulders and arms, more open side and hip stretches.
* Still not much appetite.

# Sunday 2/9 — 18th day after

**Highlight:** I realized I always feel physically relaxed now.

* When I woke up this morning, it occurred to me how strange it is to just wake up relaxed now. Before, every morning I would wake up with jaw clenched, neck/shoulders/chest sore and tight, and sometimes with a headache, often what I thought was a migraine.
   * Now I just wake up and feel rested and relaxed.
   * Last night when falling asleep, I was lying on my right side and noticed that **my left shoulder fell forward on its own. That had never happened before**, it was toor rigid/bound.
   * My entire life (that I’ve noticed — maybe after 13 or so) I have thought and said “I have a hard time relaxing,” thinking it was a mental/emotional problem, and later wondering if it was a physical issue but not knowing why.
   * On Friday I was telling friends that it feels now like my physical state matches my mental state. I’m a pretty mellow person, but **my body was never aligned with how I felt in my head**. I knew I couldn’t relax but didn’t know why, and I eventually attributed that to anxiety. I tried buproprion at the suggestion of my GP and promptly got tinnitus (which is forever and which I’m still pissed about). **I am not depressed. I do not have anxiety. I was just physically constricted. It is a profound difference to have my mind/emotions and sense of physical body all be the same.** It’s also weird to think I’ve never felt this way in 42 years.
* Right jaw/neck/shoulder strain developed in early afternoon. I noticed I had been trying to pull my shoulder down. Trying to just let it all relax. 
* Appetite still diminished.
* Yoga felt great:
    * Low lunge with back foot hold: Feels very very satisfying to be able to get so deeply into the hips. 
    * Even stronger shoulders and arms. I’ll stop adding them to this journal.
    * I’ll stop adding yoga to this journal in general. The important parts are that I regained enough strength in upper body that my neck is no longer in compensatory pattern, and that the openness in right foot and hips has been significant.
* Today I told a friend, **“I truly think my days of horrible pain and tension are behind me.”** This would not have been possible without speech therapy and frenectomy. With my physical and massage therapies, and my yoga practice, I’m feeling very good.

# Monday 2/10 — 19th day after

* Felt a pop in right arch when taking a step. No pain. Probably nothing, but I'm noting everything.
* I continue to be amazed at how symmetrical I’m feeling.
   * My lower body feels stable, balanced.
   * The openness in my right foot and ankle.
   * Open back of left hip.
   * The way I move on my feet and legs feels light and coordinated and comfortable.

# Tuesday 2/11 — 20th day after

* Physical therapist was glad to see my balance and symmetry improvements. 

# Wednesday 2/12 — 21st day after

* Left side flare up. Jaw, neck, shoulder, face, head. The usual.
* Clenched back of tongue on left side and pushed against roof of mouth. Alternated pushing gently and with force until I found a comfortable posture. The left side pain started going away.
