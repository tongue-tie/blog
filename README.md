This is an account of my experience following tongue-tie surgery. Most of the information I've come across regarding tongue-tie is about infants and children, so I'm putting this out here for adults that may find this information helpful.

This is also a common place for my ENT, speech therapist, physical therapist, and massage therapist to see my notes. Lots of therapists. I've been on a very long road that I had no idea would lead me to tongue-tie surgery.

## You had what?

I had a tongue-tie, and now I don't have a tongue-tie. I paid a nice man to remove it for me.

Basically, the [lingual frenulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenulum_of_tongue) is a bit of tissue that connects your tongue to the floor of your mouth. A short and/or restrictive lingual frenulum is called [ankyloglossia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankyloglossia), also known as _tongue-tie_. The surgery I had was a [lingual frenectomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenectomy).

Tongue-tie is also written as tongue tie, and frenectomy is also called frenotomy. There are also frenulotomy and frenulectomy. You can do your own research there.

There's a single post about my background and one for each week post-surgery. I took my notes in the moment as things happened, snippets of thoughts. Most notes are in the first three weeks.
