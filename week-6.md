# Thursday 2/27 - 40th day after

* During physical therapy routine I was able to easily hold side plank through my left shoulder. Previously it was very weak and hard to find supportive alignment. Now it feels comfortable and easy to get into position. Was also able to easily engage lower abs. Thatâ€™s always been hard to do.
* During yoga and physical therapy, I feel much more open in left, back side of ribs, from above waist to under shoulder blade.
