# Thursday 2/27 - 36th day after

* During physical therapy routine I was able to easily hold side plank through my left shoulder. Previously it was very weak and hard to find supportive alignment. Now it feels comfortable and easy to get into position. Was also able to easily engage lower abs. That’s always been hard to do.
* During yoga and physical therapy, I feel much more open in left, back side of ribs, from above waist to under shoulder blade. 
* Have been catching myself in poor posture this week, which I suspect is because my routine has been messed with. PT and yoga seem to keep that at bay. Afterward I tend to maintain a lengthened neck posture, with shoulders down, and good extension between right heel and hip, which balances me out.

# Sunday 3/1 - 39rd day after

* I suspected I had a cold. Today is confirmed. Ears and nose are affected, and neck is sore. It's my first cold in at least a year, so I guess I was due.
* I'm not sure if I stretched my neck too much on a too-firm pillow, or if this is from being sick and going back to previous posture, but I have severe pain on my right side and lots of tension at back of neck. The pain is worse than ever this weekend, like my whole right side seized up.
* Trying to stretch and loosen up the tension at the back of my head, felt more pops/cracks/pings at back of head at occipital bone.

# Monday 3/2 — 40th day after

* All pain is on left side today.
* Yoga routine yesterday released right side, today released left. In half moon, my right side is completeluy stable, I can hold it for the entire time. The left side is getting better, but hip rotation gets in the way.

I'm frustrated by the constant back and forth with the pain. When will my body balance out? I imagine I will always have these one-sides pain flareups, but I need to go back to the days of longer periods of zero pain. I'm not even done with speech therapy though, and I have not been cleared by my PT to start running again. I really want to run and be able to do some aggressive exercise. I'm patient but frustrated.
