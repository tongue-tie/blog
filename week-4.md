title: Week 4: 2/12 - 2/18/2020

# Wednesday 2/12 â€” 21st day after

* Left side flare up. Jaw, neck, shoulder, face, head. The usual.
* Clenched back of tongue on left side and pushed against roof of mouth. Alternated pushing gently and with force until I found a comfortable posture. The left side pain started going away.

# Sunday 2/16 - 25th day after

I saw my massage therapist today. The last time I saw her was the 4th day after surgery. Today, instead of the typical struggle to get into my shoulders, she said they were like butter. I asked what dairy product they usually were, and she said, "Parmesan? Aged gouda. Maybe manchego." She said again that my face was even more symmetrical.

# Tuesday 2/18 - 27th day after

* Squeezed my right foot downward in a stretch, with arch clenched, and I felt a pop at the arch. This is new. So much sensation and flexibility in the foot and ankle.
