## Thursday 1/30 — 8th day after

**Highlight:** Noticed lack of facial tension.

* Had a cramp on the right back side of my neck this morning. I’ve never felt a muscle cramp in that area before. A cramp in your neck? It as fleeting, thank goodness.
* Lots of tension on right side. Ear, jaw, tongue, shoulder, neck, back of head, etc. I can feel a strong pull in the right back of my neck when I do my speech therapy exercises.
   * I’m catching myself tensed up too. If I apply pressure to the back right side of my neck, I can let it all relax.
* Tongue is relaxing in general. Feels broader in the back of my mouth.
* Gum / inside lip irritation (had for at least a month) seems to be going away. I’ve been making an effort to keep my mouth and lips more relaxed. The irritation may have just been from tension and pulling against my teeth.
* Chewing is gentler, less aggressive.
* Not much appetite today at all.
* Yoga felt more organized. It’s nice to feel more stable on right foot.
* Right side is still flared up. Left masseter is no longer tender to the touch.
* Did some stretches for my neck/base of head. Feels a lot better.
* When washing my face tonight I noticed how little tension there is in my face. I didn’t realize that it was tense before because I didn’t know the difference. Now it feels positively slack, and my fingers detect no tension either.
* I keep catching myself with my right neck/shoulder hunched up. Trying to let it drop and hold my head up higher now that I have more range of motion.
* Head/neck/shoulder are now feeling achy and sore after all the stretching.
* The spot on the floor of my mouth that was so painful a few days ago is now fine. Previously the floor of the mouth was very tight. Now there is no tension or pain at all.
* Yawning is more and more comfortable.

## Friday 1/31 — 9th day after

**Highlight:** Feeling taller, with extended posture through neck.

* Woke up flat on my back. Still flared up on right side. Massaged masseter very lightly in shower, and upper arm after.
* Didn’t have enough appetite to finish breakfast (banana and peanut butter).
* Noticing I can sit taller, reach through my pelvis through back of neck and head. It feels like a good stretch and is relaxing. 
* Speech is softer, like it takes less effort. Lip/mouth tension is less. I’ve made an effort to relax my lips. 
* Discovered I can now feel the middle of my tongue, where the wound is, with the tip. It feels new and nice to be able to do that. 
* Right side pain subsided around midnight. Stretched out when I got home and noticed I felt more symmetrical. 

## Saturday 2/1 — 10th day after

**Highlights:** Similar muscle release and cracking sensation as on 1/27. Not as major, but the same sensations. Also, I can no longer clench my jaw — I can’t perform the action. Started purposely extending neck instead of letting neck/jaw/shoulder go into pattern of contraction.

* Maybe 5% of previous masseter pain on right side. Left is fine. 
* Right back of neck down into shoulder is tight and achy. Sometimes I recognize I can shift my posture to get it to stop. Maybe I bring it on from previous postural patterns that I need to learn to stop. 
* Tongue continues to feel better positioned in mouth. It’s always resting on the alveolar ridge, and it feels relaxed and broad. It’s really just the back right neck and side in general that flares daily. 
* Appetite still diminished. 
* Walking the art museum to let everything loosen up and relax. I feel the same cracking and stretching sensations as on Monday 1/27. Keeping head tall, neck long. Feeling a pull from right ear down neck. 
   * Steps feel lighter, more even and coordinated. 
   * Very deep stretch in back, outside of shoulders. Feels like they are further back, down, and not rounded forward. 
   * Had to take a break and sit. Pull from right jaw joint near cheekbone started feeling bad, and shoulders feel overstretched. 
   * Walking again, I stopped and dropped my head forward and back. Forward stretch gave some serious release/relief at the top of my back, just under neck. 
   * Walking, I feel pings in my pelvis, and I feel stretches on the top, outside of my hips. Gluteus medius area? It’s achy and feels like it’s the muscle, joint, bone. From very deep all the way to the surface. 
   * I noticed **I almost never tense my right foot when walking** and depend on the foot and ankle to do the work. Has shifted to legs and hips.
   * Feeling very balanced and even just walking around slowly. I want to keep walking but I also don’t want to push too much and possibly injure myself. Have to move car anyway. 
* Back at home, bottom of right foot is achy.
* Right foot is cramping as I walk around at home. Rolling it out on a trigger point ball, and using toe stretchers.
* Trying keeping my neck long/extended now that I have the range motion to be able to do that. It seems to be helping let the muscles stretch into a more comfortable position. I’m hoping it improves the right side flare-ups. I’ve been trying it for the last hour or so and it feels better through my jaw, shoulder blade. Even walking around cleaning the house, I can feel the right side hip/glutes/pelvis feels more open, and I feel balanced through my leg in general. My right foot hasn’t ached since I rolled and stretched it out. Also trying to get stretch in upper back and neck by dropping head forward.
* Jaw joint is definitely slack at rest now.
* Did a lot of upper body stretches, which felt like a strong release. I also felt pops of release in the back of my hips/pelvis, and they feel more and more level, like the tilt and rotation are unwinding. Also feel more open along ribs along my back. Started feeling that floaty/melty feeling along my back that I felt along the front of my body right after I had the surgery.
* Feeling under my chin/jaw and along the back of my neck, it feels loose, not super tight to the touch like before.
* Got chills on scalp on top of head, also a little on outside of left arm/shoulder.
* Still not much appetite.
* **I can’t even clench my jaw anymore.** If I try, there is no pressure in my jaw. Instead, I feel it in my neck / base of tongue and some tightness at the back of my head at the base of the occipital bone.
* When reaching over with right leg forward, I apply pressure from glutes to stand up. For my entire life before now, instead my right foot and ankle would tense up and drive the movement.

## Sunday 2/2 — 11th day after

* Woke up flat on my back. Slept well.
   * Turned on my right side and lengthened my neck. I could feel a stretch down my right side and into my hip and glutes.
* Standing later, I tried to keep weight on both feet as evenly as possible and lengthen my neck. I started feeling a crunching sensation at the top, back, right side of my pelvis. The stretch went from behind my ear all the way down to my pelvis.
* Standing in the shower and just lengthening my neck and trying to relax everywhere, I started feeling a stretch and loosening on both sides of my waist toward the back.
* I did some stretches to loosen up my right side more and felt great release. The ribs just above my waist in the back right side feel a little tender now.
* Trying to stand tall through my right leg and keep my neck lengthened at all times.
   * The connections to keep long and straight seem to be from my heel to the back of my right hip, and from the bottom of my right shoulder blade to behind my right ear, with shoulder relaxed.
   * Standing tall through my right leg seems to take the pressure off the upper body tension. **I never could do that before,** so it makes sense to me that it feels that way.
* Yoga:
   * In general, paid attention to keeping right back side of neck extended. Right foot and ankle continue to be flexible and are improving their range of motion.
   * Hips feel more level than ever afterward. 
   * Low lunge: More upright, deeper stretch.
   * Triangle: Very comfortable
   * Warrior series: Felt more open in back of right hip/pelvis.
   * Overhead extended triangle: Very comfortable. Outside of hip felt stable and deeper. Overhead stretch too.
   * 3-legged dog: When left leg is up, right back side of neck strains and starts to pop. I tried pressing through right arm and keeping good extension, but it still strained. Probably need to do it for a shorter duration.
* After yoga I put salve on neck/jaw/shoulder and a heating pad around shoulders and chest.
* I keep catching myself with my right jaw tensed, raised.
* Appetite still diminished.
* Noticed I was holding my breath. Let it out and relaxed, and then felt ping-y releases in right shoulder blade and a stretch up from there. 
* Right side is quite flared up. Right back of hip/pelvis (low back? glutes?) aches deeply. Going to be gentle tomorrow. I don’t want to push it and hurt myself. 

## Monday 2/3 — 12th day after

* Woke on my back but turned to sides to sleep longer. Got up kinda scrunched up in neck and chest. The freedom of movement in pelvis/hips is great though. 
* Took a walk at lunch and it loosened up the tension I’ve felt all day on my right side. I continue to feel stronger through my right leg. Engaging muscles and posture I couldn’t before. Neck feels long and I stand taller and straighter. 
* **Took a bite of sandwich at lunch and noticed a lack of strain in my jaw. I didn’t realize it had always been there before till it was gone.**
* Felt far more symmetrical walking to the bus after work. Hitting new muscles. Feels like my legs track more straight ahead. More stable feeling. 
* Yoga:
   * Spinal twists are  opening up at the waist and ribs more and more. Feels more open there.
   * Downward dog feels and looks symmetrical through lower body. This has never happened before.
   * Low lunge: Grabbed back foot when in low lunge, and got very deep hip stretch, more significantly on the right side.
   * Triangle: Lower hand position than ever.
   * Overhead extended triangle: With right arm overhead, got a great neck stretch without activating those muscles.
   * 3-legged dog: Once again, my neck muscles on the back right try to “help” when I’m inverted and more weight is on the right side. I’m making an effort to make the shoulder do the work so my neck can relax.
   * Overall, I feel like I got some good separation and stretching through my neck, and my lower body is more and more stable.
   * Rolled out right shoulder (trapezius? rhomboid?) on a trigger point ball afterward.
* Appetite still diminished.

## Tuesday 2/4 — 13th day after

* Woke up with right side flared up/strained. Tried lying on neck roll kind of pillow, which helped for a bit. Likely just need to go for a walk and loosen up.
* When standing or taking a step to bear weight on my right leg (not walking, just shifting) I find that I now naturally push through my heel instead of having my mid foot contract and trying to balance on that, with the ankle and lower leg also contracting for stability. Now I feel balanced and solid from my heel through my hip and glutes. 
   * I’m hoping that I gradually drop my previous patterns as I learn that my right lower body is now stable, and that my right upper body relaxes and stops straining and hurting. Also curious how my let side responds.
* Found a good position while in armchair in remote conferences this morning. Pain and strain on right side (neck/shoulder) is mostly gone. 
* Sitting upright in a waiting room, I feel symmetrical instead of rotated and tilted. 
* Physical therapist said jaw looked different (softer? :( ). She gave me exercises for the popped up rib on my right side. 
* Yoga:
   * Everything is more stable, symmetrical. Shoulders and arms are regaining strength quickly, which is taking pressure off the shoulder and neck.
* Leaning back in armchair, I interlace my fingers behind my head and press back with my head.  The stretch feels good and has a bit of the “cracking” sensation. Also pushing on my head like that when it is hung forward gives an incredible stretch in upper back and neck. 

## Wednesday 2/5 — 14th day after

**Highlights:** Feel more balanced and coordinated. Major muscle position change in tongue/jaw.

* Woke on right side. When I got up my neck long, strong, extended. I’ll continue to do those deep stretches before bed and see how it goes.
* I caught myself a couple times with my neck constricted on the right side, so I reorganized myself from the heel up, and it took me out of the neck strain.
* I felt no tenderness in masseters when washing face.
* I feel more balanced and organized in general. My legs feel more balanced and coordinated.
   * When standing, now that I can bear weight on my right leg more easily and balance, I’m making the effort to let my left hip/waist relax more, and they do. It’s slight but it’s there.
* Did a short sprint in the office in concrete and soft shoes and maybe strained my right foot by using previous usage pattern. We’ll see. 
* On the bus ride home, I was feeling around with my tongue position and jaw and intuitively pushed against the roof of my mouth with my tongue (at the alveolar ridge, most pressure on the right side), and **I felt a clunk/thunk/unkinking in the back of my head behind my right ear, where there is usually so much strain, and the back of my tongue (on the right side, where I get the sensation like I bit it). It felt like the muscle just under and forward of my right jaw joint also “clunked”/slid into place. It felt like the parts of my head clicked into place.** It feels like an echo of tension behind the right ear and down my neck, like it’s reacting from the lack of tension there. It also feels like a bit of deja vu, like I’ve had the clunk/thunk feeling before, but it went right back to being tense and didn’t know where my jaw and tongue were supposed go. It feels like previously I jutted my jaw forward slightly, and now it’s back and up.
* Skipping yoga tonight, just taking it easy with physical stuff.
* Also not applying a lot of pressure with my tongue on the roof of my mouth now that it’s in this position, just trying to relax.
* Getting a headache at the front of my head, which is rare.
* Right side of my neck under jaw feels sore and tight. 
* Right shoulder blade feels open instead of constricted.
