# Day of surgery 

The first thing my ENT said after he completed the procedure is that my tongue and jaw now work independently. Before the snip, when I would move my tongue, my jaw would also tense and move up. Noted and interesting, but I couldn't feel my tongue at that point, so I just took his word for it.

## Leaving the appointment

My appointment was at 1:30 pm, and I was driving back home by around 2 p.m.

* My head feels like a bobble head doll, it’s so relaxed.
* The front of my body is relaxed.
* I can breathe with less effort. I didn’t know I had the breathing tension, but apparently I did.
* My whole neck, throat, upper body feel less restricted. 
* I’m having some tension on my right side (neck, jaw) because it doesn’t _have_ to work hard anymore. It’s wild.
* I feel how I wish muscle relaxants would feel. How I always expected them to feel but they never worked. 
* I’m starting to feel my right jaw joint kinda “melt.”
* Turning my head to the right to check my blind spot when driving, I can now effortlessly see all the way out the back window.

## Back at home

The major thing I discovered that first night is that my right foot no longer felt bound. This was a new thing for me. My entire life, I had neve rbeen able to stretch it out, and my right ankle flexibility was also limited.

* It feels like every casual breath is the deepest I’ve ever breathed. I imagine it’s temporary and the sensation will normalize.
* I took a drink of water, and it was like the water just naturally poured down my throat, with almost no effort.
* When walking, I feel more symmetrical, like my right side is no longer being pulled. It feels like it takes less effort to walk.
* Right foot seems more able to open up. It’s not feeling like it wants to turn into a fist.
* 2:48 p.m.: Local anesthetic is wearing off. Took ibuprofen.
* Having waves of relaxation in arms and front of body, face. 
* Ear-to-shoulder stretch is no longer strained.
* Massaging the muscle under my chin/jaw now feels like a meaty muscle.
    * Before, it felt drum-tight.
    * I can feel the effect in my jaw and the back of my neck.
* Neck circles and moving my head/neck forward and back, side to side, and left and right doesn’t feel strained anymore.
* I can spread my right toes really wide, and afterward my foot doesn’t tense up. (This is a new ability.)
* Sitting in my armchair, my upper body is relaxed, not tense. This is unusual.
* Yoga:
    * Golf ball / trigger point ball under soles: My right foot no longer feels like it has a taut ropy band running down the center. This change is noticed/felt in most poses.
    * Low lunge: Can get my body more upright when front of right hip is being stretched.
    * Warrior 1:
        * Right foot forward: Way more stable. Right foot and ankle aren’t tense.
        * Right foot back: Good stretch in right foot. Foot and ankle are just bending instead of straining against the position.
    * Warrior 2:
        * Right foot forward: Feel more stable.
    * Triangle:
        * Right foot forward: Foot is relaxed. Previously it was slightly painful. The foot was constantly tensed. Now the foot and ankle are totally relaxed. The stretch is primarily in my upper right leg.
    * 3-legged dog:
        * Right leg on floor: Foot and ankle are relaxed and stable. VERY deep stretch in right foot and calf. Same as with warrior 3, previously the foot wand ankle were very tensed.
    * Neck circles: No jaw and neck strain.
* Just standing still, I feel far more level and stable. It seems like my hips are less rotated and tilted.
* Behind right ear is very tender. Rubbing it a lot.
* Right ear and jaw are starting to feel sore.

## Visual observations

* Lost muscle tone under chin after the release.
    * Looks like I have a double chin, fatter neck.
    * Jaw line is now very soft.
