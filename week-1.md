# Wednesday 1/22 — Day of surgery 

My ENT gave me a topical and local anesthetics, and he used laser and dissolvable sutures. The first thing he said after he completed the procedure is that my tongue and jaw now work independently. Before, whenever I would move my tongue, my jaw would also tense and move up.

## Leaving the appointment

My appointment was at 1:30 pm, and I was driving back home by around 2 p.m.

* My head feels like a bobble head doll, it’s so relaxed.
* The front of my body is relaxed.
* I can breathe with less effort. I didn’t know I had the breathing tension, but apparently I did.
* My whole neck, throat, upper body feel less restricted. 
* I’m having some tension on my right side (neck, jaw) because it doesn’t _have_ to work hard anymore. It’s wild.
* I feel how I wish muscle relaxants would feel. How I always expected them to feel but they never worked. 
* I’m starting to feel my right jaw joint kinda “melt.”
* **Turning my head to the right to check my blind spot when driving, I can now effortlessly see all the way out the back window.**

## Back at home

The major thing I discovered is that my right foot no longer feels bound. This is a new thing for me. My entire life, I had never been able to stretch it out, and my right ankle flexibility was also limited.

* It feels like every casual breath is the deepest I’ve ever breathed. I imagine it’s temporary and the sensation will normalize.
* I took a drink of water, and it was like the water just naturally poured down my throat, with almost no effort. Again, this is surely temporary and will normalize.
* **When walking, I feel more symmetrical, like my right side is no longer being pulled. It feels like it takes less effort to walk.**
* **Right foot seems more able to open up. It’s not feeling like it wants to turn into a fist.**
* 2:48 p.m.: Local anesthetic is wearing off. Took ibuprofen.
* **Having waves of relaxation in arms and front of body, face.** 
* **Ear-to-shoulder stretch is no longer strained.**
* **Massaging the muscle under my chin/jaw now feels like a meaty muscle.**
   * **Before, it felt drum-tight.**
   * I can feel the effect in my jaw and the back of my neck.
* Neck circles and moving my head/neck forward and back, side to side, and left and right doesn’t feel strained anymore.
* **I can spread my right toes really wide, and afterward my foot doesn’t tense up. (This is a new ability.)**
* **Sitting in my armchair, my upper body is relaxed, not tense. This is unusual.**
* Yoga:
   * Golf ball / trigger point ball under soles: **My right foot no longer feels like it has a taut ropy band running down the center.** This change is noticed/felt in most poses.
   * Low lunge: Can get my body more upright when front of right hip is being stretched.
   * Warrior 1:
      * Right foot forward: Way more stable. Right foot and ankle aren’t tense.
      * Right foot back: Good stretch in right foot. Foot and ankle are just bending instead of straining against the position.
   * Warrior 2:
      * Right foot forward: Feel more stable.
   * Triangle:
      * Right foot forward: Foot is relaxed. Previously it was slightly painful. The foot was constantly tensed. Now the foot and ankle are totally relaxed. The stretch is primarily in my upper right leg.
   * 3-legged dog:
      * Right leg on floor: Foot and ankle are relaxed and stable. VERY deep stretch in right foot and calf. Same as with warrior 3, previously the foot wand ankle were very tensed.
   * Neck circles: No jaw and neck strain.
* **Just standing still, I feel far more level and stable. It seems like my hips are less rotated and tilted.**
* Behind right ear is very tender. Rubbing it a lot.
* Right ear and jaw are starting to feel sore.

## Visual observations

* Lost muscle tone under chin after the release. Temporary since this is a new change?

# Thursday 1/23 — 1st day after

**Highlights:** Diminished dowager’s hump and forward head posture, better balance on right foot, deeper yoga stretches, hips starting to feel level.

* Slept well.
* Woke up sore on right side of head and neck. Sore/tight all around when I do neck circles.
   * Trying a heat pack.
   * Habit of clenching those muscles even though I don’t have to now.
* Base of tongue feels sore when I massage from under chin.
* Right foot is still unlocked. I can still relax and stretch the foot and ankle. :)
* When washing face in the shower, I massaged face muscles and base of tongue under chin.
   * I dropped my head back and felt a good stretch from chin downward, which I’ve never felt before. Tried to relax my jaw at the same time.
   * **Face felt relaxed under my fingertips. It also feels relaxed in general. Slack instead of tensed like before.**
* Instinctively using abs and right hip and glutes in a way I did not before.
* **Lower lip no longer rests against upper teeth.** I used to constantly feel the rough edge of my chipped upper tooth. 
* While driving, **bottom lip/jaw/chin started tremoring**. Mouth feels slack and full of saliva. Back of neck and base of head is starting to relax/melt instead of maintaining permanent tension. 
* Hips feel level while walking. I can feel muscles working I didn’t detect (or engage?) before. 
* Standing taller and more balanced. **Head feels less forward.** Not forced forward by tension at base of neck. Upper back, shoulders, and front of throat have that melting sensation. 
* **Eyes feel like they’re open wider and relaxed. Less tension and squinting.**
* It feels crazy to have my right foot spread out when I walk. I feel balanced as I walk. 
* I can feel my glutes (medius, I think) getting sore from minimal walking. It might be from adding 3-legged dog back to yoga routine, or a combination of both.
* Soreness on right side: molars, jaw, back of tongue, back of neck, ear. 
* Yoga:
   * Low lunge: Can get my body more upright. Stretch is much deeper, especially on right side.
   * Warrior 1:
      * Right foot forward: Way more stable. Right foot and ankle aren’t tense.
      * Right foot back: Good stretch in right foot. Foot and ankle are just bending instead of straining against the position.
   * Warrior 2:
      * Right foot forward: Feel more stable.
   * Triangle:
      * Much deeper. Can go lower on block. Didn’t use block with right hand on floor.
* Ibuprofen ~3 pm, heating pad a little before 4.
* **Swallowing is easier.** It’s almost all small effort at the bae of my throat. It’s no longer a laborious movement of my tongue trying to move food backward. It’s like my throat is already open, I don’t have to work so hard with my tongue.
* Started rubbing muscle in front of jaw/ear, and it feels like a big knot. Applying heat and rubbing more.
* **Dowager’s hump seems to have diminished.**
* **Balancing on right foot is easier.**
* Heat and massage on knotted face muscles had no effect. 
* 7:30 p.m. took a half a hydroxyzine tablet (maybe more like 1/3 of 50 mg). It hasn't worked before, but I'm trying it anyway.
* 9:15 p.m. took the rest of the pill.
* Still tight on right side.

# Friday 1/24 — 2nd day after

**Highlights:** Seated posture feels level, noticed how low appetite has been, right leg coordination is better.

* Slept well.
* Woke up on my back, with tongue snug against roof of mouth, and jaw slack.
    * Tried to keep mouth closed and in this position till I needed something to drink.
* Wound is more sore.
* Base of tongue (under chin) is sore to the touch.
* Can feel right jaw joint starting to flare up. 
* Center back of head is very tender, at occipital bone.
* Right side is continuing to flare up.
* Sensations noticed while driving:
    * Front of body feels calm and relaxed. Breathing is calm and relaxed.
    * **Back of head/neck at occipital bone is feeling “melty,” no constant tension like before.**
    * Turning right to check blind spot has better range of motion.
    * Even shifting gears feels like a smoother and calmer movement.
* **Seated in a straight-backed chair, hips feel level, posture is tall and straight and easy.** Calm and relaxed body and breathing.  I don’t feel the usual soreness/tightness in my right, outside lower leg, or back right neck. 
* 1:30 p.m. felt first bit of suture fall out. Also caught myself clenching my right foot. I was able to let it go and relax and use my hips and glutes instead. 
* **Seated, I no longer feel a pull at the back, top of my pelvis.** It used to be a permanent sensation. It’s just low and comfortable.
* Appetite seems to be diminished. Related? Who knows? Doesn't matter, just noting since that's my current state.
* **I caught myself tensing my right foot when standing up. I didn’t realize that was a habit. I knew I did it when stepping off curbs but not when standing. I’m able to spread my mid-foot and balance and use my whole leg, instead of kinda teetering on a clenched foot.**
* I can feel myself push straight through my legs and glutes instead of driving from outside of my right hip and kind of swinging.
* Less strain when turning steering wheel. 
* Climbing stairs, I feel a sensation along the back of my right side (pelvis/glutes) that I didn’t feel before. 
* Lip position when whistling is different.
* Both legs track forward when walking. 
* When eating, I feel full very quickly.

# Saturday 1/25 — 3rd day after

* Wound stung a little after I looked at it. Took ibuprofen, and it felt sore when swallowing. 
* Speech is affected by the sore tongue. 
* I kept catching myself squeezing/tensing the right jaw joint, then make myself relax. 
* While sitting cross-legged, I caught myself with my right foot tensed. I was able to let it relax and stretch out. 
* Right upper arm is achy and spasming a little. 
* 3:45 p.m. took half hydroxyzine. 
* Right jaw, face, teeth, back of neck are sore. Right scalp is tender. 
* Back of tongue on right side feels like I bit it. 

# Sunday 1/26 — 4th day after

**Highlight:** Massage therapist noticed increased facial symmetry.

* Left side of body is flaring up. Right side is calm.
* Massage therapist said my face looks different. She later said it is more symmetrical. It’s less obvious when looking at me normally, but upside down (when she’s at the head of the massage table), she can compare easily.
* ~5:30 p.m. I saw my eyes are rounder, open wider, and I have very dark circles. Left side is open wider (like always) and circle is heavier/darker.
* Realized I had been contracting my tongue for days instead of just letting it relaxe. Stuck it out, wide, for a bit, and the stretch feels good.
* Mouth feels better after stretching the middle of my tongue.
* Did more tongue stretching, and mouth feels pretty normal. Most tension is released, as far as I can tell.

# Monday 1/27 — 5th day after

**Highlight:** Major muscle release in upper body — from scalp down. Wild. WILD.

* Discovered severe soreness at base of tongue (inside mouth) on the right side. It’s like a major knot and tenderness. I don’t know how to release it but suspect it will have an affect on my ear, jaw, and neck. It seems to be my only source of pain. 
* Looking at speech in mirror, my mouth/face looks more symmetrical. 
* Yoga was uneventful. Similar to last time. 
* Muscle at base of mouth was less tender after yoga.
* Can feel muscle behind right ear and upper arm relax when I adjust my jaw and posture. 
* **I feel balanced when I walk instead of always having to work to stay upright and untwisted.**
* I feel a sharp and strong stretch down the back, right side of my neck through my shoulder and to my shoulder blade, and my right jaw joint. I also feel pulling in my ear. Trying to keep my head up, light and straight and relaxed neck. Walking slowly and gently seems to help loosen it up. Gravity helping with the pulling down.
   * While walking, I just felt a ping of release deep in the back of my right back/pelvis.
   * Now feeling a pull on left side of neck too. It started at the side/back but now it’s in front, above clavicle.
   * Now it’s on both sides. Stretching from occipital bone (like a line from ear to ear), down neck and into shoulders and clavicles and arms. Front, sides, and back. It’s becoming very strong in upper arms.
   * Now it’s a strong pull in front on the left. **This feels like my body and head are being pulled apart.**
   * Right jaw stretch seems to be softening that area and pain is subsiding.
   * Both jaw joints are soft. My face is relaxed. I feel very floaty.
   * My right eye and sinus underneath feel like they are opening up.
   * I can’t believe there’s anything more to let go, but it keeps going.
* Ribs seem to be tucked under instead of forward flared. 
* Eyes seem to be open wider. They are rounder. I look more like my mom and brother like this. Probably temporary, but it's interesting to see.
* Tongue naturally rests on “the spot” when I smile. 
* When washing my face at the sink, I caught myself with my right foot tensed and in a fist, with hip dropped. I was able to straighten it out and stand symmetrically.
* Middle of back on right side feels a little sore. 
* Not hungry at all since lunch. Appetite is definitely diminished.
* Feeling the back of my neck and head, it’s all relaxed, not tight like usual.
* **Yawning no longer hurts under my tongue.** The tie used to be stretched and get sore sometimes.

# Tuesday 1/28 — 6th day after

* Woke before six feeling totally rested. Woke up on back. Tongue is on alveolar ridge and jaw is slack. **My posture feels tall and upright. No forward neck posture, and ZERO tension in my head, neck, and shoulders. I’ve never woken up like this before.** Made coffee (haven’t in months), texted a friend. Feeling calm and relaxed. 
* Sitting in my armchair this morning, I feel an ache in my left pec, from release. It’s not tense. I can tell when I feel it with my hand too.
* Mid tongue is stretching out a lot from eating peanut butter this morning.
* Right shoulder/jaw/tongue are starting to tense up and hurt.
* Masseters are tender to touch when gliding over face in shower. 
* Driving to work, I caught myself hunching my neck up to my ears. Now I can let it go though. 
* **Now that my right leg feels “normal,” I’m noticing how my left leg is changing.**
* Neck, jaw, and base of skull feel comfortable. No tension. Tongue is always on alveolar ridge. 
* Minor tension in jaw/neck/shoulder on right side. 
* **When walking I feel taller and more upright.**
* Able to use standing desk comfortably. Lower body, anyway. Neck/jaw still go back and forth with tension. 
* I catch myself squinting then remember I can relax my face and open my eyes wider. Mostly left side. I noticed this last night too. 
* I catch myself in restricted postures in general. Trying to then take deep breath and relax. 
* Trying to keep lips/mouth more relaxed and get used to their new position. It’s subtle but I can feel it. 
* Back of tongue on right side feels like I bit it. 
* Back of head at occipital bone is fatigued. Trying to not hunch my shoulders. 
* Appetite continues to be diminished.
* Walking continues to feel balanced and stable, less rotated and effortful.
* Had my first speech therapy appointment since the surgery. Four new exercises. Starting gently with few reps. Getting good stretches that are helping relax the mid tongue too.
* Yoga:
   * Low lunge: More upright upper body, great hip stretch.
   * Triangle: Still able to go deeper, even more so on left side (left foot forward. Also felt a release deep in my low back / pelvis.
* The last of the stitches are gone as of tonight.
* Zero tension or tenderness at occipital bone or neck. Right masseter is tender to touch.
* Lying on right side, **I no longer feel (and internally hear) the grinding in the back of my left side of my pelvis. It always felt restricted, and in my mind, it was like tissue that wouldn’t let go. That’s resolved.**

# Wednesday 1/29 — 7th day after

* Woke up flat on my back again. Got up easily a little before six.
* Tested the left side of hip while lying on my right side, and the “grinding” is still gone.
* Left side felt flared up while still in bed. It definitely feels tight when going through morning yoga/stretch routine, on the left side at jaw, ear, down neck in front, side, and back.
* **Right side (foot, leg, hip) feel organized and stable. No more Trendelenburg sign. I knew I had built the hip strength, but the limitation of movement is gone, and the foot can spread and ankle can relax. I don’t feel like I’m going to fall over or twist to the right.**
    * Given how strong and stable the right side is (at last), it is highlighting the rotation and tight spots on the left. I’ve come a long way with increasing flexibility and strength, and I can now even better see the coordination, strength, and flexibility needs.
* Walking feels crooked. Left hip rotated and hiked, along with left side in general being flared up. The walking may seem more apparent due to wearing Vans. I’m usually barefoot or in barefoot style shoes. Not sure. 
* In afternoon I’m still feeling pretty rotated from the left side.
