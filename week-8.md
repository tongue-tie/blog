# Thursday 3/12 — 50th day after

* Did my first run, Week 1 Day 1 of Couch to 5k. I restarted it since I no longer have running endurance and need to see how my form develops and keep an eye on poor posture.

# Saturday 3/14 — 52nd day after

* Second run, Week 1 Day 2 of Couch to 5k.
    * I noted that my left side is hiked up. Thursday’s run felt far more symmetrical. I tried to keep my hips level and my right side active.

# Sunday 3/15 — 53rd day after

* Brutal, brutal pain. I slept like crap, woke up a lot aching deeply.
* Did yoga and other stretches first thing in the morning, for 30+ minutes. It warmed me up enough to not feel awful.
* Basically, it feels like my whole left side is seized up / contracted, from mid-thigh to my head.

# Monday 3/16 — 54th day after

* Slept GREAT. Woke up feeling energetic and totally fine.
* Figured out that if I do half moon pose on my left side, it engages my muscles effectively and lets me relax my left side instead of the constant bracing.
* Also trying to get my right side engaged/active to help my left side relax.
* Will run this evening and update more.
