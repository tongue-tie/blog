title: Week 5: 2/19 - 2/25/2020
---

Lots of flareups back and forth this week. Iâ€™m guessing partially from plane travel and not sleeping in my own bed.

# Thursday 2/20 - 29th day after

* A friend said I am limping 80% less and my mouth is straighter. 
* Severe right side flare up. Yoga and trigger point ball and hydroxyzine. 
* Lying down, can feel and hear muscle release back of head. As much as I hate the pain and contraction, my new baseline is so much more comfortable than ever before.

# Tuesday 2/25 - 34th day after

* Physical therapist said there is no obversable difference in my left and right sides when I do a particular part of my routine. Major progress.
* Speech therapist said we're getting close to the end of therapy since I'm hitting my goals and new patterns are habituated.
