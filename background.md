I never had speech or breathing issues, could stick my tongue out far, could touch the roof of my mouth with my tongue, and clean around all my teeth with my tongue quite easily. Nothing pointed to a problem. Still, I knew I had a tongue-tie since it was obvious, visually.

But I was not aware how tongue-tie affected my entire body. I have been told by my various therapists that I have an unusual level of body awareness. This is because I've been trying to figure out how to move and what will help me for pretty much my entire life.

# Note!

Everything else on this page reads like I'm a total mess. Yes, I had ear surgeries and headaches and always felt crooked, but I wasn't moping around thinking, "Woe is me," and avoiding things. In elementary and high school I played soccer and softball (poorly, but I did it) and trained with the track team, I row (indoor, with an ergometer) off an on, I started running for enjoyment and health as an adult. I've just been living my life and trying to feel better.

# Baby

I was born with [hip dysplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia) and with my right leg turned in and right foot turned under. There's a pretty great photo of me learning to walk, taking steps with the _top_ of my right foot under me. I had braces as treatment, and the turned-in and -under leg and foot resolved on their own.

# Kid

My parents put me in dance classes when I was little, as they were told that that would strengthen my hips. I recall knowing this even as a kid as young as six. I don't remember ever not knowing I was born that way and that there was something wrong with me.

I also limped. One of my strongest memories of childhood is hearing "Stop dragging your leg!" Because of that, I tried to hide the limp. I'd kind of tense up my right foot and bounce off it in order to smooth my gait overall. I'm sure that caused its own layer of problems.

I remember it being somewhat of a party trick that when standing up "straight," I could swing my right foot forward and back without it touching the ground. I didn't know at the time that it was becuase my hips were rotated and tilted.  I know there's a a lot of variation within what's "normal" for the human body, but I also saw how _many_ things were so different for me. For example, my left rib cage also sticks out further like it's  rotated forward, and I figured all these things were connected.

# Teenager

At 15 I was in a car accident. It was just a bumped fender, but my mom and I went to a chiropractor, where they took x-rays. He asked me, "Did you know that your spine is fused?" No, I did not know that. That was fresh news to me. My first thought was that that explained why I could never do a backbend like the other kids in my dance classes.

I don't have a fully fused spine, of course, or that would certainly have been obvious much sooner. But two of my lumbar vertebrae don't have a disc between them — it's just a single mass of bone. And others are partially fused, and there are some spurs too.

Another part of my quest to figure out exactly what is wrong with me (and finding ways to help it) was finding out what was up my "short leg." I had x-rays and measurements of my legs, and it was determined that they are the same length. That meant that the leg length discrepancy could be attributed to "fucntional short leg," likely due to rotation and tilt of my hips. That was not a surprise to me, as I could feel and see the rotation and tilt. It was nice to have that confirmed. It also gave me hope that if I could unwind the rotation and somehow untilt, I'd have a chance to nto feel crooked every day of my life.

## Ears

Lucky me — I was not just born crooked, there's more: I had chronic ear infections in childhood. Eventually I was told I could no longer have water in my ears at all. I wasn't allowed to go into the ocean or pools anymore (at least not with dunking my head) and for a while had to use waterproof earplugs when showering.

After years of infections in both ears (sometimes at the same time), my left ear became the real problem. At 12 I had a tube put in, and it was quickly determined that it was a waste and had no effect. From ages 13-16 I had three reconstructive operations of my left ear. They widened the ear canal, replaced my ear drum (it was completely perforated), and drilled away infected parts of my skull. Hot tip: don't get [mastoiditis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoiditis). For the curious, the procedure I had was a [canal wall down mastoidectomy](https://www.google.com/search?q=canal+wall+down+mastoidectomy). My surgeon was the incredible Dr. Roberto Cueva, 

## Headaches

I started getting terrible headaches maybe around age 17. I remember blowing a Spanish final at 19 or so because my headache was so intense. They were only on one side of my head. They'd last for days and were completely debilitating. It would get so bad that I couln't feed myself and would just lay in bed for days at a time. I missed work, I canceled social plans, I felt awful. If I got a headache, it would last 2-3 days at minimum, and I got them at least once a week. The longest was 11 days.

I was diagnosed with migraine. My mom said she had them too, and that they were less frequent and less intense as she got older.

In my twenties I tried various drugs, food elimination diets trying to find a trigger, acupuncture, so many things. Eventually I found a single drug that would help (Zomig /zolmitriptan), but sometimes that wouldn't even do the job.

# Adult

In my mid-20s, a massage therapist thought I had scoliosis when she first examined me. Once I lied down she saw it went away. I soon learned the term "functional scoliosis."

Braces! I had braces from 24-26. Before they'd put the braces on, I was advised to center my jaw as much as possible. Basically my jaw deviated to the side when I opened it. For a year before I got braces, I was in an occlusal splint and did exercises to help relax my neck and jaw and get it more centered. I knew I also spoke more out of one side of my mouth, so this wasn't a surprise, and it was just another on my list of asymmetries.

I woke up every day with tension in my jaw, neck, shoulders and arms. I clenched my jaw. I would say things like "I have a hard time relaxing." I was always physically tense. At one point I figured that it must be a physical manifestation of anxiety, and I tried to figure out how to go at the tension from that angle.

I cannot tell you how many doctors, therapists, etc. that I've gone to for assessments and assistance over the years. I've also come across ["moulded baby syndrome"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18795328) (link is for description only — I have not vetted and am not self-diagnosing), MTHFR gene mutations, midline defects, and on and on and on. Some things have been relevant, other things I've tossed into the "it doesn't matter anymore, just deal with today" bucket, and some things are quackery. It's a lot to sort, and there are a lot of opinions, and my preference is to deal with science and reality and what I can do something about now.

# August 2019: The big event and diagnosis

I had one my usual headaches, but it was lasting for days and days and getting worse. I picked up my new glasses from the optometrist, and every time they'd touch my face on the right side, the pain and pressure would explode through my face/teeth/jaw, radiating out from there to my neck, shoulder, arm. It got to the point of visual disturbance, my eyes no longer working together.

In my freaked out and pained state, I thought it had to be due to the new glasses, just trying to draw the shortest line between problem and newly introduced variable. I was not in my right mind. My optometrist office was endlessly patient and wonderful. My optometrist did an exam and said my health was normal and that he thought it was TMJ disorder (TMD) and to see an MD.

I called my ENT office, and miracle of miracles, there was a cancellation and I could be seen the next morning. That next morning I was officially diagnosed with TMD.

## Exercises and a not helpful dentist

The ENT gave me and exercise to do to help relax the jaw and advised seeing experts. Unfortuntately, I found that the exercises caused more strain and tension in my tongue and neck. I went down a rabbit hole of internet research, trying to find local professionals that could help me now that I knew I wasn't just having migraines for 20+ years, I had a jaw problem. But the jaw doesn't operate by itself, and I knew there was more to it.

In August I stopped wearing my upper retainer because it was exacerbating the pain. I went to the dentist for a separate issue, but since I was there, I told them about what had happened recently and my general history, and I asked about what they recommended for my retainer and an evaulation for tongue-tie. The dentist I spoke to said to stick my tongue out, and she said it was normal and not a problem, and to go back to using a night guard.

# September 2019: Improved tongue posture

I found that my tongue was now going to the top of my mouth instead of resting at the bottom. In the info provided by my ENT, I realized that my tongue wasn't usually in that position and I couldn't remember the last time it had been, so I made the effort to try and restore that position. I also realized that the night guard and Hawley retainer made it impossible to keep it at the roof of my mouth.

My muscle tension (jaw, neck, upper chest, etc.) went down considerably. It could have been coincidental or from stretching or vitamin and mineral supplements I started due to deficiencies, but the most likely contender was that it was due to improved tongue posture and having room for my tongue without the night guard or retainer in.

# October 2019: Speech and physical therapies

I started speech therapy and physical therapy, and I scheduled an evaluation with an ENT for December.

The speech therapist is also a certified orofacial myologist. In my evaluation she determined my swallowing pattern was incorrect, I had weak masseters, and I use the wrong muscles. And yes, my tongue is tied. Those are the highlights anyway. She also theorized that had my swallowing pattern and tongue position been correct as a baby and child, I may not have had all the ear issues I experienced. Impossible to know for sure, but it's certainly something to think about. I was familiar with the anatomy since I had studied it so much as a teenager, wanting to understand how it was all supposed to work and what was wrong with me. It also occurred to me that I was told that I cried a lot as a baby. Like a lot a lot. Maybe that was related too.

I told her her about my full-body approach to what was going on, that the visual disturbance scared the hell out of me, and that I was also seeing an ENT and physical therapist, and that I see a massage therapist regularly. She agreed with my approach, and that my overall instability certainly contributes to my jaw issues and pain. I started speech therapy and immediately started feeling better. Immediately. I also kept notes for the first 2-3 months of speech therapy and might add that later.

I also had immediate results with physical therapy. She's been the first physical therapist in over 20 years that has actually helped me. I pretty much rolled in and said "Please teach me to walk," knowing she had experience with helping patients with injuries and neurological problems _relearn_ how to walk. One part of the evaluation was particularly enlightening for me: I had very little control over my left leg from the hip. I had spent to many years concentrating on stablizing my weak right hip, I hadn't really paid attention to what was going on with my left side.

I started going to PT twice a week, then moved to once a week. And speech therapy once a week. So many appointments.

# December 2019: ENT

At long last, I went to see the ENT. Again, visually the tongie-tie is obvious. But we discussed my history and the procedure and speech therapy and the whole picture of what was going on. That week I scheduled surgery for 1/22/2020.
